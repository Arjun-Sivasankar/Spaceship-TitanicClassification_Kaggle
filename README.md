# Spaceship-Titanic: Machine Learning (Binary Classification)
This repository contains the code for a binary classification problem in which the task is to predict whether a passenger on the Spaceship Titanic were transported or not based on the "Spaceship-Titanic" dataset. This is a Kaggle competition, and the goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the test dataset.

## Dataset
Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!
The challenge is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following software installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This repository provides a solution to the Kaggle Titanic competition using various classifiers. The repository can be used as a reference to learn about binary classification, feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Feel free to contribute to the repository or use the code for your own projects.
